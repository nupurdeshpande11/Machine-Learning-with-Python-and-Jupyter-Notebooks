# Machine-Learning-with-Python-and-Jupyter-Notebooks
Data Analysis using Python on Juptyer Notebook. EDA, Linear, Logistic Regression and Clustering Algorithms are performed on multiple datasets. Datasets are: 
1. https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans/data(EDA and Clustering-KMeans and Hierarchical, Linear and Logistic Regression) 
2. https://www.kaggle.com/grosvenpaul/family-income-and-expenditure/data (EDA, Linear and Logistic Regression) 
3. https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/weatherww2/data (EDA and Data Visualization)
INSTRUCTIONS:
Ignore all checkpoints files. 
Download and run using Anaconda Prompt. Run with Jupyter Notebook. CSV files are local to my device changes will have to be made for your device. 
EDA is performed for each dataset. Prediction models are generated for Linear and Logistic Regressions.
